    desc: "A Chicken Tikka biryani is a delectable and savory Indian street food delicacy that combines the rich flavors of marinated and grilled chicken tikka with the convenience of a handheld wrap. Succulent pieces of chicken are marinated in a tantalizing blend of yogurt and spices, then skewer-grilled to perfection. These flavorful chicken chunks are nestled within a soft, warm roti or paratha (Indian flatbread), creating a delicious fusion of textures and tastes. The roll is often complemented with fresh, crunchy vegetables like onions, lettuce, and tomatoes, and generously drizzled with zesty sauces, such as mint chutney or tamarind sauce. Whether enjoyed as a quick snack on the go or as a satisfying meal, the Chicken Tikka Roll is a delightful culinary experience that showcases the vibrant and aromatic essence of Indian cuisine.",
